The CLVTools Package
--------------------

Today, customer lifetime value (CLV) is the central metric for valuing customers. It describes the long-term economic value of customers and gives managers an idea of how customers will evolve over time. To model CLVs in continuous non-contractual business settings such as retailers, probabilistic customer attrition models are the preferred choice in literature and practice.

The R package **CLVTools** provides an efficient and easy to use implementation framework for probabilistic customer attrition models in non-contractual settings. Building up on the learnings of other implementations, the package adopts S4 classes to allow constructing rich and rather complex models that nevertheless still are easy to apply for the end user. The framework is capable to accomodate a variety of probabilistic customer attition models for non-contractual settings in continuous and discrete time.

**CLVTools** implements the following probabilistic customer attrition probabilistic models:

1.  Pareto/NBD model (Schmittlein, Morrison & Colombo 1987)

2.  Pareto/NBD model with **time-invariant** contextual factors (Fader & Hardie 2007)

3.  Pareto/NBD model with **time-varying** contextual factors (Bachmann, Meierer, & NÃ¤ff 2020)

4.  BG/NBD model (Fader, Hardie, & Lee 2005) 

5.  BG/BB model (Fader, Hardie, & Shang 2010)

Further, the **CLVTools** provides an implementation of the Gamma/Gamma model for modeling the average spending of customers per transaction (Fader & Hardie 2013; Fader, Hardie, & Lee 2005). 

In addition, **CLVTools** provides the functionality to use advanced modeling techniques (support of these options varies by model):

-   Correlation of the purchase and the attrition process

-   L2 regularization for parameters of contextual factors

-   Equality constraints between parameters of contextual factors for the purchase and the attrition process.
